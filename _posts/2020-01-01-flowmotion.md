short: Communication between automated vehicles and pedestrians by means of liquid.

## Description
The automotive industry will shift towards a higher level of automated driving in the future. Communication of intent from vehicles to pedestrians is currently being achieved through kinematics of the vehicle as well as communication via eye contact and gestures of the driver. However, in fully automated vehicles where the driver might be absent, this communication is missing.

To bridge this gap, we developed an intuitive novel way of conveying intentions that can replace the traditional modes of communication. Through different iterations of material and shape explorations, we created a final concept, based on the familiar motion of fluids.

The goal of this design project is to investigate whether fluid motion can bridge the gap of the lack of communication of intent from automated vehicles to pedestrians.

This proof of concept is a step towards implementation in the next generation of future cars.
