## Description
In order to safely cross a road, you check your surroundings. If a car is nearby, you need to pay extra attention and communicate with the driver of the car. Most of the time you try to communicate non-verbally, making eye-contact, hand gestures or flash lights from a car. In a situation where the vehicle is automated, this human to human communication will become human to computer communication. The small non-verbal communications therefore need to have a replacement. Earlier studies have shown that projection based communication from a vehicle facilitates one of the clearest forms of automated vehicle to pedestrian communication in ideal situations. This study aims to discover the best way to use this projection-based communication in order to allow pedestrians to safely cross.
