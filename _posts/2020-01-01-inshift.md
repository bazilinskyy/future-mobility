## Description
Modern cars are getting more complicated and distracting. InShift minimizes distractions from the infotainment system by involving the front seat passenger and having them act as the co-driver. The driver can delegate controls such as navigation to the right side by sliding the slider. The system will move to the passenger side, and avoid being in the gaze of the driver. The passenger will have their own user interface where they have helpful features for the driver, such as setting up destinations and monitoring car information.
