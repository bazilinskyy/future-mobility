## Description
Rydes, providing an alternate way of spending time in future vehicles.

With the coming of automated vehicles, people travelling will have more free time and attention. This creates the possibility of entertainment, which will be explored through gaming. An iterative process is shown that starts with a folding table for gaming and content consumption, but could not function in a semi-automated vehicle. Then the interactive possibilities in a car are explored, highlighting the importance of interactivity. Following this, the PLEX framework is used for improving the interactivity. The interactive, multimodal setup developed for children in this paper demonstrates how time could be spent in future vehicles, using the pre-determined space in the car for creating a new gaming experience.
