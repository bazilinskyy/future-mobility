## Description
I, Thijs Baselmans, was captivated by the big potential offered by public buses. I examined the experience of riding a bus and explored ways to improve it using a variety of approaches: Firstly, an extensive look was taken into the role of the bus driver and how it might evolve considering developments in the field of automated driving.

Also, users were actively involved. Through interactive exercises and interviews they helped envision what the future of bus travel might look like, identify pain points and review concepts.

In presenting these design visions for the bus interior of 2035, I propose new furniture and layouts that allows for a wider range of seating options as well as opening the bus up to more different activities while riding. This should create a space that feels more engaging, comfortable and safe.
