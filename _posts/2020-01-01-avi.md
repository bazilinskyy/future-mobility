## Description
2024 is the year that most car companies are eyeing for to release fully automated vehicles (AV) commercially. The taxi industry sees great potential of realising an AV taxi service system, which would be more environmental friendly, safer and more time efficient. This sounds incredibly promising, however, how will the future passenger interact with the automated vehicles? AVI is an Automated Vehicle Interaction service that enhances the initial interaction between a fully automated vehicle taxi and its future passengers, within an urban environment. Usually the driver is there to confirm your ride through eye contact or a small hand gesture. The AVI service gives you the opportunity to send a personal input to your assigned vehicle. The AV will respond to you with this input on its display, so that you recognise your AV taxi from a distance and even in a busy environment.
