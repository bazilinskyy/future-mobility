short: Exploring external signals from automatedly driven vehicles for vulnerable road users.

## Description
The future of traffic lies in autonomously driven vehicles. This will require changes in how communication is done between these autonomously driven vehicles and vulnerable road users. While a wide variety of eHMIs has been explored to bridge the gap between autonomously driven vehicles and vulnerable road users, this research specifically explores the effect of colour and shapes this in urban traffic scenarios. By defining which signals should be communicated, when, and in what form, the proposed eHMI system Mosi was made. The proposed design focuses on the scenarios when an autonomously driven vehicle needs to brake, accelerate or turn in an urban setting, and how this can be anticipated by vulnerable road users. These designs were then tested through user tests with pictures and videos to explore these scenarios.
