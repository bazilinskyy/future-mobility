short: Testing augumented reality concepts in virtual reality.
---

## Description
Through the use of a VR module, these augmented reality interactions are displayed in a virtual car which is supported by three use cases of the near future:

1. How will we handle and answer phone calls?
2. What would the driver do in case of a non-intuitive navigation?
3. What is the function and impact of unknown buttons in the car?

My client Cerence will benefit from this project by decreasing the time, effort and money spent on a project as it will be much quicker for the development team to test and implement. Watch the video, gain insights from the progress poster, and feedback will be very much appreciated!
