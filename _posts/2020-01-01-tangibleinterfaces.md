## Description
Future cars contain more and more screens, which can be distractive and therefore dangerous. With this in mind, a tangible interface was developed for a car interior to change temperature and music without a screen. By replacing the visual feedback with haptic feedback, the driver does not have to take his eyes off the road, which makes everything safer.

The first two iterations consisted of a broad and a narrow exploration. With foam, cardboard and flexible textile, over 30 models were generated. Furthermore there was an analytical part to see which models had the greatest potential.

The third iteration eventually resulted in the final design and during this iteration, a broad user test was done to determine size, material, placement and function.

For the final design, a rotating unit was developed which contained two different tangible interfaces. A clear separation between functions results in a clear tangible interaction without distractions.
