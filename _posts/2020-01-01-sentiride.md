## Description
Did you know that your emotions influence your ability to drive? When you’re for instance angry or sad whilst driving you’re not able to focus enough and this can lead to dangerous traffic situations. Although car drivers can put their car aside from the road, chauffeurs such as bus drivers are not able to stop in the middle of their shift.

SentiRide is an interactive tool to help the bus driver to stay focused, this is done by using interventions within the driver environment and displaying the driver’s performance. SentiRide intervenes automatically when the arousal level of the driver is deviating from the optimal performance level. The display of the driving performance urges the driver to better utilize his driving skills for optimal driving performance.
