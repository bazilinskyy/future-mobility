## Description
This project investigated office workers’ desires for Non-Driving-Related Activities (NDRA) during their commute in self-driving cars, and how such a car’s interior can support this. With the advances on the technological front of automated vehicles it is not yet clear what certain users require during their commute. The research consisted of web-based surveys (distributed among students and office workers) and focus groups (consisting of office workers).

We present a highly adaptive interior. This is necessary as desired NDRA of commutes vary based upon the destination (commute to work ≠ commute to home). In a commute to work, light office work is desired. In a commute to home, relaxation to clear the mind is preferred.
