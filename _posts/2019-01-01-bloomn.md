## Description
What if our products could move like how flowers grow? Bloomn is a steering wheel that is able to bloom open when the user wants to drive him/herself and fold in to devolve in automated mode. The steering wheel can help the user to drive more economically by communicating if the driver dives too inconsistent or over the speed limit. It communicates this by expanding a little bit, creating a slightly more rough surface, the steering wheel is at that point is stress and relaxes if the driver drives efficient.
The Steering wheel is inspired by the AVTR concept car by Daimler. It is a car completely inspired by the futuristic movie Avatar and focuses on the way the creatures is the movie are connected with nature. Bloomn is aimed at the path in time towards the AVTR, for when automated driving and the technology is not completely possible yet.
