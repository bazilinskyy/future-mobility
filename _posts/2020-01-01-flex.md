## Description
Most private cars aren't used for 80% of the time while taking up about 50 percent of our real estate ground. Therefore, in the future, it will be more efficient to have access to a shared self-driving car. However, not everybody uses the car for the same means. To optimize the space inside of the car, the FLEX interior consists of individual panels. These panels can move horizontally or vertically and have 2 different sides. These can create a table, chair, or wall. When ordering your shared FLEX ride, you can select in your app what you are planning to use it for. For example, to take your bike with you or to work with colleagues whilst travelling. When the car arrives, it will transform itself into the right configuration for you to work, move, or meet.
