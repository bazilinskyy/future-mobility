## Description
Grow your carâ€™s garden by using energy wisely

GROW is a concept targeted at people owning electrical automated vehicles (level 3 or higher). Its aim is to help people in making conscious choices related to the three aspects of ride sharing, route choice, and general electricity usage. It does so by rewarding these choices by acting as both a game and a decorative feature. This connects to the idea of future car interiors becoming more like personalized living rooms. The gaming aspect concerns taking care of your digital plants, which impacts their aesthetic appeal.
