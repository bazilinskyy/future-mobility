## Description
Our project addresses the following research question “How does visualizing the connection between two in-car infotainment systems enhance communication between back seat and front seat passengers?”. We conducted a survey and ran a co-creation group session. We found out that there is an ‘invisible barrier’ that blocks the communication between the back seat and the front seat passengers within a car. To contribute to the solution of this problem, we propose a design where the infotainment system can be interacted with from both back and front seats and visualizes the communication between the different seat rows in a car. Furthermore, the design offers both information and entertainment functions. To find out if our proposal performs well in terms of usability and user experience we conducted several Skype interviews to see what a group of young people think of the concept. We received overall positive feedback and some ideas for improvement.
