## Description
With the change from normal cars to self-driving cars, opportunities for new activities in the car will arise. Without a driver having to watch the road, especially the social interaction within a car gets more freedom.

Social interaction plays a substantial role in people's lives and will forever be a prominent activity. However, social interaction in a car is shared with attention to the surrounding traffic. How will this interaction proceed when the car drives itself, how will the interior adapt to this situation and what will be the preference of the user?

In this project, we looked at the changeable sitting position and how this interior factor will influence the social interaction. It will give the knowledge for the future self-driving cars in which the car can adapt the interior according to the user's unconscious needs or preferences. Our research can make sure that your future conversations are flowing.
