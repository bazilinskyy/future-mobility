short: Designing an interface to improve transitioning vehicle control from computer to human.

## Description
My objective is to design an interface to improve transitioning vehicle control from computer to human. I focus on increasing the driver’s understanding and take-over performance by allowing the driver to prepare for a possible take-over.

A highly automated vehicle is able to drive itself most of the time, and doesn’t require a human to monitor the environment. However, if the situation changes, the user might be required to take over, which can be difficult. A possible solution is to add a 'monitoring phase': a transition phase where the human monitors the environment, thus understands what is going on before a take-over is required.

Do driver take-over understanding and performance improve by adding a monitoring phase in-between full automation and a take-over request?

Five design iterations, a UX test, and a user study resulted in a final design proposal, and research conclusion.
