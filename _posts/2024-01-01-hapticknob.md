## Description
This paper introduces a non-intrusive haptic feedback knob designed for automotive control systems to enhance driver safety and efficiency. Integrated into the vehicle's dashboard, the knob provides custom haptic feedback for functions like climate control, audio, and navigation settings. The functions are displayed on the car's windscreen on a heads-up display. This allows drivers to operate the knob without looking away from the road, reducing distractions and maintaining focus on driving. Subtle vibrations and resistance changes indicate different control states, enabling intuitive, eyes-free operation. The development and evaluation of this haptic knob highlight its potential to reduce driver distraction and improve in-car function adjustments, promoting safer driving environments.
