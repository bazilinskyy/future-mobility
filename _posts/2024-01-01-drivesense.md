## Description
This study examines a multimodal internal Human-Machine Interface (iHMI) designed to improve situational awareness (SA) for drivers in Level 3 and 4 automated vehicles. As these drivers often engage in non-driving tasks, maintaining SA is crucial for responding to vehicle take-over requests (TORs). The iHMI combines haptic feedback from vibration motors in the car seat and visual feedback on a centre console screen to non-intrusively communicate vehicle movements and traffic information. User testing in a driving simulator revealed that this feedback significantly enhanced SA and comfort (p = 0.041) without being intrusive. Future work will refine the iHMI and validate its effectiveness and user acceptance in real-world scenarios with larger sample sizes to ensure comprehensive SA and effective TOR responses in diverse driving conditions.
