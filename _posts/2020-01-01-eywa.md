## Description
Our world’s infrastructure is moving towards an automated future. Which means that years from now we will be driven around in our vehicles, while no human drivers are involved. Current developments in automated driving indicate that all cars will have monotonous driving behaviour. The problem we foresee in this is the loss of connection with one’s car as it no longer expresses the passenger. Inspired by the Avatar movie, where nature being connected is a prevalent topic, we try to solve this problem with Project Eywa.

Project Eywa translates its passenger’s personality, behaviour and preferences into driving behaviour, and simultaneously communicates these traits of the passenger to the environment. By redesigning the hub of the AVTR car and using flaps and lights for communication, project Eywa makes an attempt to preserve the connection between car and passenger.
