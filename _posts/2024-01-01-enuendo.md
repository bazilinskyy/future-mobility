## Description
Over the last few decades, automated vehicles (AV) have become less of a sci-fi dream and more part of reality. However, personal research suggests that some people might still be wary of AV and how they act in traffic. This could stem from the lack of trust in AI, which is the brains behind AV and its decisions in traffic. To mitigate this lack of trust or uncertainty around AV, we have developed a tool that can be implemented, much like the display in the car itself, but now made to fit the rear window of the AV. This will display information about where the car will go or what other traffic is in front of it.
