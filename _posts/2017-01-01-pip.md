## Description
This ambitious driven project aims to provide a suitable solution for the goal defined by the client Connexxion: trying to get car owners out of their cars and into public transportation. After an exploration phase, a project direction was set: creating a personal planning application which provides the user with the available travel possibilities. Through research and user testing, trigger points were found that could stimulate people to choose public transportation over car use. These trigger points were implemented in an application called PIP. User tests with the application showed positive results towards the idea of PIP, however improvements are required in order to fulfil the users desires.
