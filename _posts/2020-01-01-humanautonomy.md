## Description
Artificial intelligence will have a pervasive and profound impact on society and technology, itâ€™s influence can already be seen in the field of automated driving. From where cars are now, to fully automated vehicles there will be a time where humans will need to take over control because the car cannot drive during those specific events.

My research is part of the Human AI Alliance and aims to maintain human autonomy during that transition of control. A user interface was created with the goal of increasing transparency, supporting predictability and improving visibility during the transition.

This will increase the trust in the system, create a feeling of control and give agency to the human which in turn maintains their autonomy.
