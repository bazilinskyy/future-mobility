## Description
Designing for public transport users with the goal of improving passenger flow by lowering the dwell time of a bus. This is realized by experimenting and testing with the seating layout and use of zones.

Given the increasing demand for mobility, public transportation becomes more and more important. To create a vision, a future scenario was developed in which the bus would never had to stop any more. Therefore this project is based on improving the passenger flow in public transport buses within five to ten years. The aim of this project is to improve passenger flow and consequently increase journey satisfaction. A concept was designed in order to improve the flow by using a different seating plan. With this layout, multiple zones were introduced. These zones were classified on different lengths of travel. The use of zones is tested within an abstract setting and a realistic setting. With the results of both of the user tests, one final bus design interior is created.
