## Description
In the future, many of the vehicles will be unmanned and self-driven, picking people up and delivering goods. However, there are still many obstacles ahead, like the interaction between automated vehicles and other road users. In previous research, while testing these vehicles, misbehaviour in the form of bullying occurred. Think about obstructing the car, performing a brake test or take their right of way over the AV. The goal of this study is to expand on the little existing knowledge and propose a mitigation design. In order to do that my research is split into three sections: Identifying the participant, Identify the causes and Investigating mitigation approaches. All these sections together give an oversight about who the participant is, why they would behave like a bully and which design would help to mitigate their misbehaviour towards automated vehicles.
