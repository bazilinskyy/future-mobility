## Description
Ambius is a light-system integrated into a bus seat that creates a personal ambiance. This light-system helps to improve the travel experience of travellers.

The atmosphere in coaches is often monotonous and the same all over the bus. Ambius is a light-system integrated into a bus seat, that creates a personal ambiance. The light can be set to different scenes for different atmospheres. In addition, the light can also provide information for travellers. During long journeys, the light can help by reducing motion sickness or simulating a circadian rhythm. To change the light settings, travellers can use the integrated textile buttons on the seat in front of them or use the app for more customization. By doing so, people will be able to travel in their personal ambiance and receive personalized information.
