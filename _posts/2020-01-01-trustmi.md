## Description
The technology for fully automated cars is getting closer and closer. This is a great thing, since we envision that robots can drive more safely than humans. However, there is a problem with trusting these cars. Would you dare to step into a vehicle where there is no control? Research shows that 78% of US drivers are afraid of riding in a self-driving car. We must make sure that passengers get a great first impression every time they experience a new situation, so they can execute their office tasks while feeling comfortable.

We want to help and came up with the TrustMI Project. It provides the right information to the user at moments they do not have enough trust. It shows the user that everything is under control, and can explain why it made certain decisions. It combines this with visualizing the cars surroundings in a non-distractible, butt relaxing way.
