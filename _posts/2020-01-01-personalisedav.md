## Description
What if you could use cars and furnish them just like your own home?

Creating the possibility to treat an AV interior like a living room by creating a personal experience user are able to emotionally bond with their AV interior. This could fit well with several dealerships. By creating a new dealership model automotive companies are prepared for future change.

By looking at bonding with the product we want to encourage sustainability. This will be developed through personally customizable designs.

A personal customizable design is different for every user. Through personalization, the best user experience in AV can be achieved. We hope to anticipate the future of AV and transportation. Our vision is to make self-driving cats accessible and better user experience with an eye on sustainability and user experience through personal commitments.
