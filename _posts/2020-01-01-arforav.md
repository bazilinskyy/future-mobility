## Description
Before we reach a future in which mobility can be fully automated, we will deal with a temporary phase in which cars offer conditional automation (level 3): this means drivers must be assured that, under certain circumstances, it is safe to let go off the steering wheel and the car has everything under control. How can we convince the driver to trust the carâ€™s automated driving capabilities?

This research project explores how a driver could gain trust in a level 3 automated car through a full windshield-size head-up display (HUD). This HUD can be used to overlay useful traffic information and create a form of augmented reality. Through showing its understanding of the current traffic situation, the car makes sure the driver feels assured it is safe to hand over steering control.

This concept will be modelled and tested in a driving simulator through exploring which information users appreciate.
