## Description
Electric cars are becoming more common nowadays. 75% of all people in the Netherlands do not have their own driveway because they live in an apartment for example. As a result, they cannot build their own charger and enjoy careless charging but have to schedule when and where they will charge their car, which is stressful and uncertain. With StekkerTogether, private electric charger owners can share their charger with neighbours to create a community that’s not commercially focused; an opportunity that hasn’t been explored yet. The platform allows users to book a private charger in their neighbourhood for a cheaper price compared to public chargers. Private charger owners, so-called Hosts, can set a Start price, a price per kWh and set the days and times at which their charger is available for others.
