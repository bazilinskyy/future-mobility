## Description
Currently, police cars used by the Dutch police force are modified civilian cars made suitable for patrolling the region and quickly responding to calls, but this compromises the usability and effectiveness when compared to a vehicle designed for this task from the ground up. A lot of areas of improvement were identified after some desk research and an interview with two officers. During this project, a concept car was designed that could be produced in 2050 with features that improve upon these areas with a focus on the user experience. These features include a fully electric drivetrain, automated or manual control, a steering wheel that can be used to report the officersâ€™ findings, a large computer screen for the co-driver, a connection to the system at the department, and smart seating. The concept was developed with multiple feedback sessions with the officers, which keeps the design user-focused.
