## Description
It is very likely that in the future humanity will use and ride around in fully automated cars. Before we get to this future, we will need to go through a transition in which we must learn to trust automated cars. That will be a challenge.

Various studies show that current trust in automated cars is low. To improve trust, other studies have shown that users must be provided with a continuous flow of personalized information.

ITE is designed as a new way to improve trust in automated cars that are not fully automated (level 3 / 4 automated cars). The system provides the user with a continuous flow of personalized information through elements integrated in the dashboard of the car. Via the movement of the elements, the user intuitively gets provided with information about Future Actions of the car, its Situational Awareness, Warnings and the car's Uncertainty.
