## Description
Today, bus interiors are aimed at maximizing passenger capacity. Though beneficial for city bus travel, this may hinder intercity bus travellers.

Passengers of intercity buses often complain about cramped seating, the inability to properly work due to posture issues and lack of space to place equipment, and being put off by the noise of fellow passengers.

Customized Seating System is a future bus interior that divides intercity buses into sections aimed at work, quiet commute or group travel. Each section will have customized seating, adapted to the passengersâ€™ activity and needs.

Passengers will be able to reserve a chair up front via a mobile application. Each passenger can create a personalized pattern for their seat, that will light up during check-in, to recognize their designated chair. Passengers can opt for the pattern to remain on their chairs during travel, to express their identity.
