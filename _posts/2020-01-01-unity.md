## Description
UNITY, a mobility vision concept, which combines the aspects of both car and house by a physical connection. Trying to foresee the future, around 2040, most houses of today will still be standing by then. Internally things will differ, however the overall shape will remain. The types of houses that are now most popular in the Netherlands are the semi-detached houses. Which is the reason why I used this format.

Cars and houses are becoming increasingly more connected through the decades, which will transfer into the future. This leaves an opportunity for the car industry. Car manufacturers are already becoming technology companies, due to the fact of the automatization in the mobility sector. Diving deeper into the options for attaching the house to the car and bringing this to the customer as an extra service when one wants to buy a new car.
