## Description
In 10 years from now when vehicles could become fully automated, drivers will become passengers. We see an opportunity in using this freed up time in a more meaningful way. Mercedes Relive is designed to provide you personal memories to explore, bringing forgotten memories back to life.

When the car detects when you are wandering off, subtle triggers invite you to engage with the experience. It provides you with personal memory cues based on the current environment and time flashbacks; Is the weather bad, what about exploring your sunny memories? Are you on a busy highway, fancy thinking back about calm forests? Or perhaps look back at your trip from 4 years ago.

While engaged, abstract memory cues will start floating on your windows. The more you interact the more details will show, stimulating your imagination. Mercedes Relieve aims to enhance the driving experience while improving your mental well-being.
