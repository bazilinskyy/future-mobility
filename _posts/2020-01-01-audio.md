short: Redesign of music music control in a car.
---

## Description
Car music control systems have traditionally been designed for the radio. Music streaming services often feel like an afterthought in car interfaces. The AUD_I/O project redesigns music interactions from the ground up with streaming, big data, and future mobility in mind.

This fundamentally different design basis resulted in new and innovative interactions. Music recommendations are augmented by journey data, such as location, speed, road type, E.T.A., and many more. Furthermore, passengers can easily couple to the car's music listening session, creating a more social environment where everybody can enjoy the music. This social aspect is not limited to within the car. The AUD_I/O system even provides the opportunity to send music between cars, while waiting for the traffic light to turn green, for example.
