## Description
This research project is dedicated to defining automation surprise that a driver experiences in a level 3 automated car, when they are engaged in a non- driving related activity in non-critical driving scenarios. Through behavioural studies and experiments, this project aims to explore what emotions are directly linked to automation surprise and how it can be prevented or mitigated. Based on the results of this research, a multi-modal and nonintrusive interactive feedback system can be designed to make the drive more comfortable and luxurious.
