## Description
Our current transportation environment is undergoing a technological transition, resulting in a range of new mobility scenarios. In addition, the relevance of future personal (auto)mobility is challenged by developments in urban planning, changing legislation, and social opinion. Future vehicles and their users thus are required to adapt. This project asks how future cars can retain their relevance in the future context of urban environment, and how a personal vehicle demonstrate adaptivity through choices in exterior design. The challenge is approached through morphing exterior volumes - serving as the vehicle's tools for conforming to its surrounding environment.
